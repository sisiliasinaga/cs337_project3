The code for this project is written in Python 3.7. The dependencies it uses are the natural language toolkit (nltk),
requests for retrieving information from a given URL, and BeautifulSoup for webscraping.

To run the code, launch ingredients_and_steps_parser.py. The terminal should open and prompt for a recipe URL from AllRecipes. The terminal will then print out
this recipe and guide the user through the steps, ingredients, and any questions the user has.
